We need to modify the interface to allow users to insert new dogs and modify or delete the older ones. (so we should adda list box populated with the dog's information)
We are going to show this information in the dog_interface (interface tier) by retriving it from the dog_data (data tier) via the dog methods (business rules tier). Similar coding will be added to lab.php to produce the dogs list box previously mentioned.
lab.php also needs access to all the information from a particular dog that has been selected.
We are going to use AJAX paired with lab.php to retrive and show all the needed information about the dogs.
We must make sure that the user indicates what type of operation is requested before we populate the form objects (text boxes, list box, and radio button).
We are going to modify the code to create the form objects only after the user selects a dog from a dogs list box.
